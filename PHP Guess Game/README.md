# PHP Guess Game
 A browser-based, word guessing game: "PHP Guess Game"

## Instructions

A random word will be chosen, and will appear on the game board along with a clue.

Each time the player guesses a letter, the game compares the letter the player has chosen with the random word. If the letter is in the word, the game board displays the chosen letters on the screen.

A player continues to select letters until they guess the word (and win), or make five incorrect guesses and lose.

If the player completes the word before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly 5 times, a losing screen appears.

A player can guess a letter only once. After theyâ€™ve guessed a letter, the game will disable that letter on the onscreen keyboard.
